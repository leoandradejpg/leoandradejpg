**ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Leo!**

I am a Software Engineering student with a passion for creating solutions that combine technology, design, and social impact.

My love for interfaces and technology started at a very young age, driving me to dive into Design studies during my teenage years. Today, I focus on developing user-centered, practical solutions, especially in education-focused projects.
Currently, I work at Incluir, a company based in Rio de Janeiro, where I create applications that blend innovation, functionality, and meaningful experiences for neurodiverse children and neuroscience professionals.
I believe that the intersection of user-centered design and technology is a powerful engine for transforming lives and building a more inclusive future.

My longest creative experience was as a Creative Director at Duloren, a company where I have been working for 7 years.

Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python
Frameworks and tools: Expo, React Native, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Gluestack UI
